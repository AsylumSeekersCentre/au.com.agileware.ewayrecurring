# eWAY Recurring Payment Processor for CiviCRM

This payment processor extension allows you to implement recurring payments on
your CiviCRM site using the Token Payment processor.

It is originally based off work by Chris Ward and Henare Degan.

In addition to the basic support offered by the original extension, this version
allows you to specify a particular day of the month to process all recurring
payments together.
